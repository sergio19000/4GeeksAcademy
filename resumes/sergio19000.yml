        when coding and editing webpages took my attenction i've decieded to take a try
        into studiying a degree about coding, with no previous knowledge, at the 
        begining was a little bit hard to me to follow the lessons, after that i keep working,
        just focus on coding, with exercises and lessons finally i know a little bit more of this sector.
